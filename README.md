# du

This is a Windows-only command-line utiltity for retrieving directory information (directory size, number of of files and sub-directories).

While this is a usable tool, the repository is also used as a testing area for changes to CMake build settings, github actions, etc. that once worked out will be propagated to other KeyWorks repositories. As such, you might see a bunch of commits that don't affect the way the tool works, just how it's being built.
